# FeynmanHs

This Haskell project generates Feynman diagrams given a number of external sources, vertices and "legs" per vertex.

Most equivalent diagrams are removed from the result, but some symmetries are not accounted for, so manual review of the results is required.

The code was written to check my answers for a homework exercise in my QFT course, and currently only considers very simple Feynman diagrams, since that is all the course provided me with at the time of writing this code.

This is also my first proper project in Haskell, so it is probably not thoroughly optimised, and there are certainly some mistakes in my commit history. But I am happy with the end result (which is why I made the project public).
